## **Overview**

In this project, we implemented a CNN model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 10 different classes such as airplanes, cars, cats, and dogs. The project covers:
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Designing a CNN architecture
- Training, validating, and testing the model
- Performance evaluation using metrics and visualizations

## **Dataset**

The CIFAR-10 dataset contains:
- **Training Images:** 50,000
- **Test Images:** 10,000
- **Image Dimensions:** 32x32 pixels, RGB format
- **Classes:** Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck
